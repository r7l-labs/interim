# War Tutorial (Player Guide)

This short guide explains how wars work on servers running the Interim plugin.

## What is a War?
A War is a PvP conflict between Nations (or between towns if configured). Wars enable PvP between participants in areas where PvP might otherwise be restricted.

## Who can start a War?
- Typically only nation leaders (capital town mayor) or players with the `interim.war` permission can declare war.
- Use `/nation war <target>` (server-specific command if enabled) or check with your server staff for the exact command.

## When a War starts
- A War object is created by the plugin and both sides are notified.
- During an active war, PvP is allowed between participants even inside towns and claims.

## How to participate
- Join a nation or be part of a town in one of the nations involved.
- Participate in PvP and objectives set by your nation or server admins.

## Rules while at war
- PvP between war participants is allowed; non-participants may still be protected.
- Claims remain owned by the towns; wars do not automatically transfer land.
- Admins may enforce additional rules (no raiding of certain protected structures, etc.).

## Ending a War
- Wars can end by surrender, timeout, or manual admin intervention.
- After a war, server admins can adjust claims or award territory manually.

## Helpful tips
- Coordinate with your nation leaders before declaring war.
- Protect valuable items and backups — wars can be disruptive.
- If you are unsure about server-specific war rules, ask an admin or check the server's rules channel.

If you'd like a more feature-rich war system (auto-conquest, siege mechanics, auto-claim on victory), I can implement those features — tell me which mechanics you'd like.
